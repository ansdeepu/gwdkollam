              <AccordionContent>
                There are three main roles in this application, each with different permissions:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Editor:</strong> Has full, unrestricted access to all features. Editors can create, edit, and delete all file entries (Deposit Works, ARS, Rig Registrations), manage staff and user accounts, approve pending updates from supervisors, and set GWD rates. This role is for administrators.</li>
                  <li><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Has restricted, site-level editing rights. Supervisors can only see and edit their assigned sites from the 'Deposit Works' and 'ARS' pages. Their changes must be approved by an Editor. They cannot create new files, edit file-level details like applicant name, or manage other users.</li>
                  <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Has read-only access across the entire application. Viewers can see all data, reports, and user lists but cannot make any changes. This role is for observation and monitoring purposes.</li>
                </ul>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-5">
              <AccordionTrigger>How do supervisors submit updates?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Supervisors can edit their assigned sites through the 'Deposit Works' or 'ARS' pages by clicking the "Edit" button on a file. After making changes to the site-specific fields and clicking "Save Changes", the update is submitted for review. It does not change the data directly. An Editor must then go to the "Pending Updates" page to approve or reject the submission. The site will be locked from further edits by the supervisor until the update is reviewed.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-3">
              <AccordionTrigger>Why can't I edit a file or site?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Editing permissions are based on your role:
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Editors</strong> can edit anything.</li>
                  <li><strong>Supervisors</strong> can only edit sites they are assigned to, and only if the site's work status is "Work Order Issued", "Work Initiated", or "Work in Progress". If an update has already been submitted, the site is locked until an Editor reviews it.</li>
                   <li><strong>Viewers</strong> cannot edit anything.</li>
                </ul>
                 If you believe you should have editing rights, please contact an administrator.

             <AccordionItem value="item-6">
              <AccordionTrigger>What is the difference between 'Deposit Works' and 'ARS'?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                The application separates projects into two main categories for specialized management:
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Deposit Works:</strong> Found in the "File Room", this section is for all standard departmental projects like Borewell Construction (BWC), Tube Well Construction (TWC), Mini Water Supply Schemes (MWSS), etc. It uses a comprehensive data entry form that handles all aspects of these complex files.</li>
                  <li><strong>ARS (Artificial Recharge Schemes):</strong> This is a dedicated module for managing ARS projects like check dams and recharge pits. It has its own simplified data entry form and a bulk Excel import/export feature specifically tailored for ARS data. ARS entries are managed separately and will not appear in the main Deposit Works list.</li>
                </ul>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-9">
              <AccordionTrigger>What are the 'Rig Registration' and 'GWD Rates' pages for?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-sm">
                   <li><strong>Rig Registration:</strong> This module is for managing the registration and renewal of all drilling rigs operated by private agencies. It tracks agency details, owner information, and the status of each individual rig, including its registration validity and renewal history.</li>
                   <li><strong>GWD Rates:</strong> This page serves as a master list for all standard departmental items and their approved rates (e.g., drilling rates per meter for different diameters). This data is planned to be used for automated estimate generation in the future.</li>
                 </ul>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-7">
              <AccordionTrigger>How can I export data to Excel?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                On pages like Establishment, ARS, GWD Rates, and Reports, you will find an "Export Excel" button. Clicking this button will generate and download an XLSX file containing the data currently visible on that page. If you have applied any filters (like a date range or search term), the exported file will only contain the filtered results. This allows you to create customized data exports.

              <AccordionContent>
                For security, all new user accounts must be manually approved by an Editor. If your account is pending approval, you will not be able to log in. Please contact the administrator to have your account activated.

            <AccordionItem value="item-2">
              <AccordionTrigger>How do I reset my password?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                You can change your password from your Profile page. Click on your name in the sidebar at the bottom-left, select "Profile", and use the "Change Password" form. If you have forgotten your password entirely, please contact the administrator for a reset.
