              The Ground Water Department is the state-level agency entrusted with the development, management, conservation, and regulation of precious ground water resources. The department provides technical guidance for various schemes, including well construction, groundwater recharge projects, and water supply systems for both government and private sectors. Its key services involve hydrogeological surveys, drilling, and monitoring to ensure the sustainable use of groundwater for drinking, agriculture, and industrial purposes.

            <AccordionItem value="item-1">
              <AccordionTrigger>What are the different user roles?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                There are three main roles in this application, each with different permissions:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Editor:</strong> Has full access to all features. Editors can create, edit, and delete all file entries (including ARS and Rig Registrations), manage staff and user accounts, approve pending updates, and set GWD rates.</li>
                  <li><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Has a focused view. Supervisors can only see and edit the specific sites they are assigned to via the 'Deposit Works' page. They cannot create new files and their changes must be approved by an Editor.</li>
                  <li><strong>Viewer:</strong> Has read-only access. Viewers can see most data, including all files, reports, and user lists, but cannot make any changes.</li>
                </ul>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
             <AccordionItem value="item-8">
              <AccordionTrigger>Why are table headers fixed on some pages?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                On pages with long tables like 'Establishment', 'GWD Rates', and 'User Management', a "freeze pane" effect is used on the table headers. This keeps the column titles visible at all times while you scroll through the data, making it easier to understand the information without losing context.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-2">
              <AccordionTrigger>How do I reset my password?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                You can change your password from your Profile page. Click on your name in the sidebar at the bottom-left, select "Profile", and use the "Change Password" form. If you have forgotten your password entirely, please contact the administrator for a reset.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-3">
              <AccordionTrigger>Why can't I edit a file or registration?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Editing permissions are based on user roles. 'Editor' roles can create and edit all parts of any entry. 'Supervisor' roles can only edit specific fields on sites that are assigned to them and are still active. 'Viewer' roles have read-only access and cannot make any changes. If a Supervisor has submitted an update for a site, it will be locked until an Editor reviews it.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-4">
              <AccordionTrigger>What does 'Pending Approval' mean on my user account?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                For security, all new user accounts must be manually approved by an administrator with an 'Editor' role. If your account is pending approval, you will not be able to log in. Please contact the administrator to have your account activated. The main admin user cannot be deleted or have their role or approval status changed.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
             <AccordionItem value="item-5">
              <AccordionTrigger>How do supervisors submit updates?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Supervisors can edit their assigned sites through the 'Deposit Works' page. After making changes, clicking the "Save Changes" button will submit their updates to an administrator for review. The changes will not be applied to the main file until an admin approves them from the "Pending Updates" page. The site will be hidden from the supervisor's view once an update is submitted and will reappear only if the update is rejected.
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
             <AccordionItem value="item-6">
              <AccordionTrigger>What is the difference between 'Deposit Works' and 'ARS' pages?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                The two pages manage different types of work:
                 <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Deposit Works:</strong> This is for all standard departmental work files (BWC, TWC, MWSS, etc.). All data entry and management for these projects happen here.</li>
                  <li><strong>ARS:</strong> This page is exclusively for managing Artificial Recharge Scheme sites. It has a dedicated data entry form and bulk Excel import functionality tailored for ARS projects. ARS data is kept separate and will not appear in the main Deposit Works files.</li>
                </ul>
              </AccordionContent>
            </AccordionItem>
            <AccordionItem value="item-7">
              <AccordionTrigger>How can I export data to Excel?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                On pages with an "Export Excel" button (like Establishment, GWD Rates, ARS, and Reports), clicking this button will generate and download an XLSX file containing the data currently displayed or filtered on that page. The pop-up dialogs on the Dashboard also have an export button to download the specific details you are viewing.
